# ShowOnDesktopTemp
Temporarily “show” the contents of a chosen folder on your desktop without copying anything. How: It creates symlinks (shortcuts) on the desktop to the selected folder’s immediate children and records exactly which links it made. Use: In Nautilus, right-click a folder → Scripts → show_on_desktop_temp. First run: creates the temporary view on your desktop. Next run: offers to clear the current view or replace it with another folder. Safety: It never deletes real files. On clear, it removes only the links it created (tracked in a hidden manifest). Existing desktop items are left untouched; name collisions are skipped. Notes: Press F5 on the desktop if icons don’t update immediately. The script also works with localized desktops (uses xdg-user-dir DESKTOP) and refuses to “show” the desktop itself.

Works so far on Ubuntu's latest LTSes with Nautilus. The procedure is to place the script in ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/ and enable it with chmod +x. It needs to have a shell extension showing the desktop icons, like the Desktop Icons NG (DING) extension.
